For Checking the proper working of collaboration

How to implement it ?

git clone <our_repo_url>
cd <our_repo_name>

git checkout -b <your_unique_branch_name> origin/branch_joel

make your changes

git add .
git commit -m "<Your-Message>"
git push origin <your_unique_branch_name>


and finally we merge them all to the branch main


So to test it
Make the value of x to 10 and push it to your branches


<<<<x=5>>>>
After you completed your task pls message me.
